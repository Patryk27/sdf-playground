## About

sdf-playground is a demo showcasing how you can run Rust code on the GPU - it
consists of two parts:

- the application (run on the CPU, inside `./app`),
- the shader (run on the GPU, inside `./shader`).

Application is responsible for spawning the window and telling GPU to execute
the shader, while shader is the one which generates all the colors.

Shader here implements a ray-marcher for signed distance functions, but in
principle it can be anything you want, e.g.:

``` rust
#[spirv(fragment)]
pub fn main_fs(out_color: &mut Vec4) {
    // out_color.x = R (0..1)
    // out_color.y = G (0..1)
    // out_color.z = B (0..1)
    // out_color.w = alpha (technically 0..1, but actually unused here)

    // Renders a yellow rectangle
    *out_color = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0); 
}
```

## Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Patryk27/sdf-playground
$ cargo run --release
# (might take a few minutes the first time, but should be faster then)
```

Note that the code first builds the application, then starts it, and then builds
the shader - so for a few moments (until the shader is ready), the window will
be just pitch-black (you should be able to see the shader's compilation progress
in the terminal, though).

On the upside, modifying the shader doesn't require restarting the application -
simply change `shader/src/lib.rs`, save it and wait a few seconds for the
application to refresh!
